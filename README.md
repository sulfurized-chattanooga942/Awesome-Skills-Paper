| **XSkill: Continual Learning from Experience and Skills in Multimodal Agents**<br>Guanyu Jiang, Zhaochen Su, Xiaoye Qu, Yi R. Fung | XSkill is a dual-stream continual-learning framework that distills visually grounded **experiences** and **skills** from multimodal rollouts and retrieves/adapts them at inference time, and it consistently outperforms both tool-only and learning-based baselines on five benchmarks with four backbone models. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2603.12056) |

| **When Single-Agent with Skills Replace Multi-Agent Systems and When They Fail**<br>Xiaoxiao Li | This paper studies when a multi-agent system can be “compiled” into a single agent with a skill library, showing competitive reasoning accuracy with lower token usage and latency but also identifying a **phase transition** where skill selection collapses beyond a critical library size. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04748) |
| **Agentic Proposing: Enhancing Large Language Model Reasoning via Compositional Skill Synthesis**<br>Zhengbo Jiao, Shaobo Wang, Zifan Zhang, Xuan Ren, Wei Wang, Bing Zhao, Hu Wei, Linfeng Zhang | Agentic Proposing treats data synthesis as a sequential decision process over composable reasoning skills and trains an Agentic-Proposer-4B with MGPO, and a 30B solver trained on only **11K** synthesized trajectories reaches **91.6%** on **AIME 2025**. | [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03279) |
